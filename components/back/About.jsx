        Tantrotrotsav is the annual technical festival of the Amrita Vishwa
        Vidyapeetham, Chennai Campus. The festival celebrates the spirit of
        innovation, engineering, and technology with a diverse range of
        competitions, workshops, lectures, and exhibitions. The name
        "Tantrotsav" combines the Sanskrit words "Tantra," meaning technology,
        and "Utsav," meaning festival, symbolizing a vibrant celebration of
        technical prowess and creativity. This fest features an array of events
        such as hackathons, coding challenges, robotics competitions, tech-talks
        by eminent personalities, panel discussions, and hands-on workshops
        aimed at fostering technical skills and knowledge. Exhibitions
        showcasing cutting-edge projects and demonstrations of emerging
        technologies are also key highlights of the event. Traditionally held
        over three action-packed days, Tantrotsav is entirely organized and
        managed by the students of Amrita Chennai Campus, emphasizing teamwork,
        leadership, and innovation. It attracts participants from all over
        India, making it a hub for collaboration, networking, and the exchange
        of ideas. Having grown significantly since its inception, Tantrotsav
        continues to inspire and empower young minds to think beyond boundaries
        and shape the future of technology.{" "}
